// Since the original file was left out for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the file contains code that uses variables named "brevity", "it", "is", "correct", and "and".

// A proper solution would involve examining the original code and either importing these variables from
// another module or initializing them appropriately based on their intended use.

// Without the original code, I cannot provide a more specific or accurate solution.
